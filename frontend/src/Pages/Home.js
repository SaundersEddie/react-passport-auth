            <p>This is a work in progress page, so please excuse the mess while items get cleaned up and shuffled around.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this project was to do a fairly simple react app, that implemented API coding, react, and react-bootstrap. </p>
            <p>The code itself is not some complex code and visually pleasing masterpiece. Many improvements can still, and will be made over time.</p>
